50 watt bluetooth 'portable' speaker

<h3>About</h3>
  You know when you spend lots of money on some little pill-shaped bluetooth speaker, and it sounds like absolute crap? Well I have been looking around, and can't seem to find a bluetooth speaker that sounds amazing, and doesn't cost a metric s**t tonn.
  I'm gonna keep it simple here;
  <b>Mega Bass</b>
  the whole reason I am building this speaker is because of the bass, I want bass, baAaAaAaaaAAaSsSSsss. Like "vibrate the walls" bass, and for that, I used an 8" driver, THX grade, logitech Z2100. Now I know thats acually a speaker set, but I just look the massive subwoofer and used that.
  <b>tweeters</b>
  Now I didn't want to clog my box with 5 different speakers, so I used a pair of Rockford Fosgate FAC2203's, these 3" tweeters are nice because they extend well into the midrange, allowing for a 3 speaker setup (left channel tweeter, right channel tweeter, subwoofer).
  <b>Amplifier</b>
  My first option was to make a small amplifier out of a LM386 IC (you can find that project, along with the scematics here
  https://easyeda.com/STERFRY333/Bass-Boosted-Audio-Project). But when it was all assembled, it sounded like those bass boosted meme songs, so I then decided to go with a car amplifier. I decided to use a USAcoustics USA2050 50 watt because I found it at a thrift store for $20.
  <b>power</b>
  Well the amplifier required 12V 20A to run, now obviously you can power this with AA bateries, A car battery is waaaaaaaaaaaaaay to heavy, and making a house current pluggin defeats the purpose of 'portability'. So I went with my quad battery, why? Because It is small, and still supplies enough power.
  <b>box</b>
  I got lazy in this part of planning, mostly because designing a speaker box is a lot of work, I'm not even gonna get into all the tuning and proper sizes you have to have because it's giving me a headache just thinking about it. So I used a guitar amp box, why? Becaue thats all I had.
